<h2>Instalation</h2>
    <li>Copy the code of the repository</li>
    <li>On your terminal locate the folder in which you would like to take the files and then press: <strong> git clone </strong> and then paste the code copied on the repository</li>
    <li>Once the files are cloned to the local file, in your terminal write <strong>code .</strong>. this will eventually open VSCode </li>
    <li>Work on the website and apply all the changes needed and when the progress is considerable write in the terminal <strong> git all .</strong> this will appply all the changes</li>
     <li>Write <strong> git commit -m (any text with the changes made) </strong> this will commit all the changes made so far</li>
    <li>Whenever the code is ready to upload it to the repository write <strong>git push origin master</strong>. If it is not the master repository then the code to write is <strong>git push origin main</strong> this is the location of the main branch.

<h2>Usage</h2>
 
 <p>This project has been created in order to review some important content related to the use of React components as well as passing properties among components. It also shows the logic behing the creation of an App and at the end it keeps the record of the account balance of an individual just like if it were in a bank</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>At the begining it was intended to show the logic of a user's account balance in a bak and how it is modified by a deposit or a withdrawal. Futher versions could implement the use od a validation of a user and a password to enter the platform and to have acces to personal transactions just like it were in a real ATM machine.</p>
